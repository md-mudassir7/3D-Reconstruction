Developed a deep learning based model that can generate 3D structure of the object from its 2d images. The 2d images were taken from all possible angles covering the object in its entire with same camera. The technique used was structure from motion 

Tools used: mesh-lab and open3d for visualisation 
Technology stack: Deep learning, python, computer vision, structure from motion
